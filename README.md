## Welcome to the Miami Valley Traffic Net

The Miami Valley Traffic Net **meets weekly on Monday evenings at 7:00 PM local time** and as activated.

We use the [Montgomery County ARES](http://mocoares.org/) K8MCA repeater [146.640](https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/details.php?state_id=39&ID=6728) (_Offset: -0.6 MHz, PL Tone: 123.0_)

### Purpose

>The National Traffic System (NTS) is a structure that allows for rapid movement of traffic from 
origin to destination and training amateur operators to handle written traffic and participate in 
directed nets.

> During disasters or other emergencies, radiograms are used to communicate information critical to saving lives or property, or to inquire about the health or welfare of a disaster victim.
